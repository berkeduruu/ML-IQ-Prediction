# ML-IQ-Prediction
a machine learning homework about IQ Score Prediction

The database consists of 2000 rows and is made with chatGPT (I did not focus much on it since the subject of the assignment is processing the database rather than create a database)
The aim of the assignment is to compare the models, not to use the best-fitting algorithm.
I did very well, I do not claim that this is the right thing to do, and I am not an expert in the work, I created this place just to be found.
